Project Overview

ObservabilityStack is a minimal, local-friendly observability lab using OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, and Tempo. It targets quick experimentation on a single-node Kubernetes cluster with simple ingress via Traefik.
	‚Ä¢	Telemetry: OTLP (logs/metrics/traces) via OpenTelemetry Collector
	‚Ä¢	Visualization: Grafana (anonymous access by default)
	‚Ä¢	Logs: Loki (multi-tenant capable)
	‚Ä¢	Metrics: Prometheus (scrape + alerting)
	‚Ä¢	Traces: Tempo (distributed tracing backend)
	‚Ä¢	Ingress: Traefik (installed manually)

‚∏ª

Libraries and Frameworks
	‚Ä¢	Kubernetes (local cluster such as Rancher Desktop/minikube/k3d)
	‚Ä¢	Helm for chart-based installs
	‚Ä¢	OpenTelemetry Collector for telemetry pipelines
	‚Ä¢	Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, Tempo (Grafana Labs ecosystem)
	‚Ä¢	Traefik (Ingress Controller)

‚∏ª

Platform Support
	‚Ä¢	Primary: macOS and Linux (fully documented and tested)
	‚Ä¢	Limited: Windows (basic guidance only - static hosts file approach)
	‚Ä¢	Note: Project maintainer has deep experience with macOS/Linux; Windows support is minimal and community-driven

‚∏ª

Coding Standards
	‚Ä¢	Shell (bash): POSIX-ish, set -Eeuo pipefail; echo intent before actions
	‚Ä¢	YAML: 2-space indent, comment non-defaults, prefer small diffs; keep overrides in separate files (e.g., *-local.yaml)
	‚Ä¢	Commits: Semantic Commit Messages style eg feat: add hat wobble
	‚Ä¢	Safety: use dry-runs by default (helm upgrade --install --dry-run --debug, kubectl apply --server-side --dry-run=client)
	‚Ä¢	Prefer git add -u befor git add . if files only updates, and use git add filname if new file etc.

‚∏ª

Documentation Standards

	‚Ä¢	Structure: Use clear, hierarchical organization with consistent markdown formatting
	‚Ä¢	Language: Write in clear, concise English or Swedish as appropriate for the target audience
	‚Ä¢	Code examples: Always include working, tested command examples with expected output
	‚Ä¢	File organization:
		‚ó¶	/docs/INSTALLATION.md: Complete setup instructions from zero to working system
		‚ó¶	/docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md: How to use the system once installed
		‚ó¶	/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Emergency procedures, debugging, and complete command reference
		‚ó¶	/docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md: Git and development workflow guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Cross-references: Always link between related documentation sections
	‚Ä¢	Verification: Include verification steps and expected results for all procedures
	‚Ä¢	Updates: Keep documentation current with code changes; update docs in same PR as feature changes

Emoji Usage Policy

	‚Ä¢	Functional only: Use emojis exclusively when they serve a clear functional purpose
	‚Ä¢	Approved contexts:
		‚ó¶	Status indicators: ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è üîÑ (success, failure, warning, in-progress)
		‚ó¶	Alert levels: ‚ö†Ô∏è üí° (critical, warning, information)
	‚Ä¢	Prohibited: Decorative or casual emojis that don't add functional value
	‚Ä¢	Consistency: Use the same emoji for the same meaning across all documentation
	‚Ä¢	Accessibility: Always pair emojis with clear text that conveys the same meaning

Branching Policy

	 ‚Ä¢  No direct commits to `main` are allowed.
		 - All feature, fix, and experiment work MUST be done in feature branches.
		 - Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` prefixes recommended (e.g., `feat/add-otel-collector`).
		 - Create a Pull Request targeting `main` and require at least one reviewer before merge.
		 - Ensure CI checks pass and any required approvals are completed before merging.
		 - Use protected branch rules in the Git provider to enforce this policy.

	 ‚Ä¢  Emergency fixes to `main` are only permitted via a review-approved fast-forward or a revert+PR workflow; coordinate with the team and document the reason in the PR.

Operations Guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Install (GitOps): ./scripts/install_argo.sh - installs ArgoCD and deploys the complete observability stack
	‚Ä¢	Manual sync: ./scripts/force_argo_sync.sh - forces ArgoCD to sync changes from Git
	‚Ä¢	Ingress/Hosts: configure dnsmasq for wildcard DNS resolution (see docs/INSTALLATION.md for platform-specific instructions):
		‚ó¶	macOS: address=/.k8s.test/127.0.0.1 in /opt/homebrew/etc/dnsmasq.conf + /etc/resolver/k8s.test
		‚ó¶	Linux: address=/.k8s.test/127.0.0.1 in /etc/dnsmasq.conf + NetworkManager/systemd-resolved integration
		‚ó¶	Windows: Use static hosts file (wildcard DNS not supported in lab setup)
	‚Ä¢	Access:
	‚Ä¢	Grafana: http://grafana.k8s.test (anonymous by default). To enable login, set in grafana_values.yaml:

grafana.ini:
  auth:
    disable_login: false
  auth.anonymous:
    enabled: false


	‚Ä¢	Loki: http://loki.k8s.test (supports multi-tenancy via X-Scope-OrgId)
	‚Ä¢	OTel Collector: http://otel.k8s.test (configure receivers/exporters in opentelemetry_values.yaml)

‚∏ª

UI/Dashboard Guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Keep Grafana dashboards minimal and focused on smoke tests (one panel per signal type).
	‚Ä¢	Provision datasources via grafana_values.yaml; avoid manual setup drift.
	‚Ä¢	Prefer dashboard JSON in /dashboards and auto-provision them.

‚∏ª

Quick Smoke Tests
	‚Ä¢	Push a test log to Loki (tenant foo) and verify with logcli:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST -s \
"http://loki.k8s.test/loki/api/v1/push" \
--data-raw '{
  "streams": [
    {
      "stream": { "job": "test" },
      "values": [["'"$(date +%s)'"000000000", "fizzbuzz"]]
    }
  ]
}' \
-H "X-Scope-OrgId: foo"

logcli query --addr=http://loki.k8s.test --org-id="foo" '{job="test"}' --limit=5000 --since=60m



‚∏ª

Troubleshooting (Shortlist)
	‚Ä¢	Ingress not routing ‚Üí check Traefik install and Ingress objects
	‚Ä¢	Grafana empty ‚Üí verify datasource provisioning and service URLs
	‚Ä¢	No logs/metrics/traces ‚Üí check OTel pipelines, exporter endpoints, and component pod logs

‚∏ª

Design Notes
	‚Ä¢	Minimal footprint and fast setup for local experimentation
	‚Ä¢	Keep risky changes behind *-local.yaml overrides
	‚Ä¢	Prefer small, well-explained PRs with a short test plan

‚∏ª

Documentation Maintenance

	‚Ä¢	Accuracy: All documented commands must be tested and verified to work
	‚Ä¢	Completeness: Every feature and configuration change requires corresponding documentation updates
	‚Ä¢	Target audience: Documentation should be accessible to developers setting up their first observability lab
	‚Ä¢	Real-world testing: Include common error scenarios and their solutions
	‚Ä¢	Version compatibility: Document which versions of tools/charts are tested and supported
	‚Ä¢	Cleanup: Remove outdated or obsolete documentation promptly; maintain a clean information architecture
